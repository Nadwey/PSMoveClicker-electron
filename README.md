# PSMoveClicker-electron

Program was primarly made for ADOFAI, but you can use it as a mouse.

Btw, I'm not responsible for breaking your PSMove or something else (it shouldn't happen as long as you keep the force close to 0)

## Usage

Program requires psmoveapi but i will probably include it in the build
